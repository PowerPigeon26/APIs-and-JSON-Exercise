Hi! This project was made to familiarize myself with APIs in C#. The first part uses the kanye.rest and ron-swanson-quotes API to get quotes from Kanye and Ron, and then display them to the console like they are conversing with each other. For the second part, the OpenWeatherMap API was used to allow the user to specify a city, and then the API would return weather information about that city, in this case we just display the temperature in farenheit.
